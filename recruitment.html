    <!-- Application Steps -->
    <section>
        <h2>Application Process</h2>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
            Below is a basic example of what an application process could look like.
            This is inspired by real police recruitment, but simplified for learning purposes.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 1: Learn About the Role</h3>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
            Read through this page and learn what the fictional BCIT Police Service does on campus. 
            Think about why you want to join and how you could contribute to safety at BCIT.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 2: Check the Requirements</h3>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
            Make sure you meet the minimum requirements listed above. If there is anything you are unsure 
            about, you would normally contact a recruiter for more information.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 3: Submit Your Application</h3>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
            In a real process, you would submit an online application form with your resume and a short 
            cover letter. For this project, you can imagine filling out a form that asks about:
        </p>
        <ul class="main-paragraph">
            <li>Your name and student number.</li>
            <li>Your contact information.</li>
            <li>Why you want to join the BCIT Police Service.</li>
            <li>Any volunteer or leadership experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 4: Interview &amp; Basic Screening</h3>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
            If this were real, applicants who meet the basic requirements might be invited to a short interview. 
            The interview would focus on your behaviour, values, teamwork, and problem-solving skills.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 5: Training &amp; Orientation</h3>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
            Successful applicants would attend a fictional training session at BCIT. Training might include:
        </p>
        <ul class="main-paragraph">
            <li>Campus safety procedures.</li>
            <li>How to communicate with students and staff.</li>
            <li>Basic emergency response awareness.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Call to Action -->
    <section>
        <h2>Interested in Applying?</h2>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
            This recruitment page is for a school project only and is not a real job posting. 
            However, if you are interested in campus safety or law enforcement in real life, 
            you can visit official police department websites or talk to a BCIT advisor about 
            related programs and careers.
        </p>
        <p class="main-paragraph">
            For this project, you can pretend to “contact a recruiter” by visiting our 
            <a href="contact.html">Contact page</a> and imagining what questions you would ask.
